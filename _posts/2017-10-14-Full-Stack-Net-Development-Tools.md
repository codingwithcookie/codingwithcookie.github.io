I was recently asked what software I have installed on my machine. So here is my list of software I have installed on my machine to help me as a Full-Stack .Net Developer:

Visual Studio 2017 | [Download](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)<br/> I have an MSDN subscription witch gives me an Enterprise License. The main feature I use that is not available in the Community Edition is the web based load testing.
SourceTree | [Download](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) Provides a great graphical interface for git source control while also managing multiple repositories.
Fiddler4 | [Download](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler/fiddler4) Great for inspecting traffic around http endpoints. I have discovered several times the data I was sending to an endpoint was incorrect.
Docker for Windows Beta | [Download](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)I use this primarily to stand up a new Redis Database to prevent any stale data during development cycles.
Skype | [Download](https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/) This is my primary communication tool for chatting and screen sharing.
Slack | [Download](https://slack.com/downloads/windows) I subscribe to various Slack groups for staying engaged in the community.
GoToMeeting | [Download](https://support.logmeininc.com/gotomeeting/get-ready) This is my secondary screen sharing tool.
Office | [Download](https://products.office.com/en-us/get-office-oem-download-page) Outlook, Work, Excel and PowerPoint are all staples of the business world.
Chrome | [Download](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html) My primary web browser and their developer tools are excellent for front end development. I have debugged many bugs in my Angular applications.
FireFox | [Download](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) Once my code is working in Chrome I verify it in FireFox to get another perspective.
Postman | [Download](https://www.getpostman.com/) Alternative to Fiddler. I primarily use it when sending files to an http endpoint.
VS Code | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) Lightweight IDE and great for when I’m doing focusing on front end development. And now my primary choice for updating this blog.
Git | [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Required for SourceTree and I use [this StackOverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11451535/gitignore-is-not-working) when I inherit a project with an incorrect .gitignore file (or a missing one).
Redis Desktop Manager | [Download](https://redisdesktop.com/download) Easy way to inspect a Redis cache and look at the Keys and Values.
Node.js | [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) Several front end tools use node packages like gulp and browserify.
SQL Express | [Download](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853017) My primary database. This lets me have a local database during development. And help prevent me from screwing up someone else database.
SQL Management Studio | [Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) Direct access to SQL Server via GUI. It simplifies access to multiple databases and severs and allows access and automatic firewall updating of Azure SQL.
Adobe PDF Reader | [Download](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) Various documents come in pdf format and Adobe reader is the most common in corporate environments. Also if I output to a pdf format I want to verify Adobe Reader can open it.

Please let me know what you think of these tools. I’m always looking for tools and software that will help me become a better developer.

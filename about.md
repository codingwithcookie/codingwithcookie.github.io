I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) focusing on crafting microservices that enable the interactivity of Microsoft Learn. My formal training is in Paramedicine where I practiced emergency medicine in rural Arizona for 8 years. During that time I taught myself how to code and now working to shape collaborative teams.

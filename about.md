I'm a Software Development Engineer on [docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com) focusing on services within the Developer Relations Team. My formal training is in Paramedicine where I practiced emergency medicine in rural Arizona for 8 years. During that time I taught myself how to code and now working to empower every developer to achieve more.
